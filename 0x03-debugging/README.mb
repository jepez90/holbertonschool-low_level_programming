### 0-main.c

### 1-main.c

Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

### 2-largest_number.c

This program prints the largest of three integers.

### 3-print_remaining_days.c

This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
